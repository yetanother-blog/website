When [André](https://twitter.com/_andrewsecret) and I launched this blog last
year, we always wanted to create a simple, performant, and accessible tech blog.
We live in Europe so we have to deal with cookie law banners, privacy policies
or other legal details. It was clear to us, that cookie law banners are super
annoying and we wanted to do everything we can to avoid such a bad experience.
On the other hand, we also wanted to have a lively blog with cool integrations
such as showing code examples directly on our blog. Sadly, many existing
solutions set cookies, have a ton of features or just a bad performance so we
had to come up with our solution.

## Demo

Let me introduce [Indiepen](https://indiepen.tech/): A privacy-friendly tool to
embed HTML, CSS, and JS code examples.

With Indiepen, you generate a code snippet and integrate it on your website.
Indiepen takes care of fetching the HTML, CSS, and JS files and providing a
shiny preview of the code example. The cool thing: Indiepen is not a hosting
platform, instead, you provide an URL of your code example, and Indiepen does
the rest. You can host your code examples with every hosting provider!

[getting started guide](https://indiepen.tech/#get-started).

## At a glance

No one likes to read wordy articles, so here are the features at a glance:

- Fun: Embed your HTML, CSS and JS code examples with ease
- Fair: No cookies, no tracking, no external requests
- Fast: Small footprint with less than 20 KB
- Inclusive: Features built for everyone
- Transparent: Open-source software

## Open source

Indiepen is our first open-source project, and we are super excited to share our
ideas of a fast, fair, and transparent web with you. We can’t wait to hear your
feedback! Feel free to check out
[our code on GitHub](https://github.com/yetanother-blog/indiepen/), open an
issue or create a pull request. We built Indiepen because we wanted to embed
code examples on our blog, but now it’s time to see what you do with our little
project.

That’s it for today. Get in touch with me on
