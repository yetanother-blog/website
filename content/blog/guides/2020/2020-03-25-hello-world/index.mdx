## Introduction

This guide will help **Frontend Engineers** and people from the **UI Community** to develop a common understanding
of **collaboration** and why this particular skill can improve the processes of software development and product design in
your company. I will **not** describe implementation details or how to create the next big Design System. But I will provide
you the right tools and practices to build a Pattern Library or even a Design System. It will also help people who
already maintain a Pattern Library. To get a better common understanding of problems or situations in a company I will
do some storytelling.

## The Status Quo Story

Let's imagine ourselves in a successful company with a customer-centric application. There is a **development** and a **design**
department with a bunch of cross-functional teams. Now let's take a look at the different roles:

### The Designer

**Job Title:** Senior Product Designer

**Team:** Unicorn ðŸ¦„

**Job Description**: always dreaming about consistency and impossible animations. Apparantly this person is often stuck in meetings with managers and other designers.
Besides that meetings this person is responsible for the design files, which are only accessible on request
for developers or product managers.

**Current Task:** After a long meeting with other designers everyone agreed to do small improvements to their design library.
That person decided to update the design files to a new shiny color palette to imrpove the accessibility.

### The Developer

**Job Title:** Senior Frontend Engineer

**Team:** Delicious âœ¨

**Job Description**: is passionate about bleeding-edge technology and loves code refactoring. Either that person doing it
the right way or that person is just not doing it at all. Constantly implementing new features and maintaining several
Single Page applications in the frontend and a Pattern Library is the daily business for that person.

**Current Task:** implementing a new Product Teaser, but that person recognized some inconsistencies in the typography. Nevertheless
that person is implementing the code because he would never question the design file.

### The Product Manager

**Job Title:** Product Manager

**Team:** Deliver ðŸ“¦

**Job Description**: The Product Manager is usually busy with meetings or reading wordy docs. After all that bullshit that person needs to
think about a vision together with the team of how they can improve their product.

**Current Task:** that person is currently in a meeting with **product designers** and **developers** to explain the next things on the
road map. That person is talking a lot about business values and showing some Jira tickets for the upcoming sprint. Sadly Neither the designer or the developer can understand
that person because there is no common terminology between those people. In theory, the PM just wants to tell you that we need
to build feature A in product B by the end of C.

## The Problem

Those people are living on different planets and they don't speak the same language.
This is often the root cause of why Pattern Libraries or Design Systems are failing in companies.
Usually, a Pattern Library is initially developed and maintained by **Frontend Engineers**, but nobody else knows about this Project in the company.
It's getting harder to maintain this project because the design files are changing so fast. Eventually,
the developers gave up using the Pattern Library, because it is not aligned with their new design files at all. Nobody feels
responsible for mainting the **Pattern Library**. Last but not least we have the Product Manager who never saw this Pattern Library. Now you can really feel those barriers between those people.
They are not collaborating with each other! Let's sum up the problems:

- lack of terminology
- lack of interdisciplinary collaboration
- lack of responsibility

## The Solutions

### Don't Listen to Your Manager

Another method to achieve consistency and alignment in your Pattern Library accross the company is to not listen to your manager.
This sounds in the beginning disrespectful and dangerous, but in theory it works pretty well. You just need to find a balance
between your daily business and your current goal you want to achieve and it can be anything. In our case the goal is to achieve alignment
and consistency in the UI development. As a first approach I would take one hour per day to spend time on your goal and by getting
a better feeling for it you can always increase the time. Be careful with this approach, if your manager will tell you to focus on the daily business you should
probably reduce the time again and do more daily business. This is the moment where innovation and good ideas happen and I'm pretty
sure that a good manager will be thankful in the end for your commitment. When you have something to show, then it's time to be more visibile.

### Create a Guild

A guild is a group of people who are working interdisciplinary on a problem. What are the requirements for a guild?

- motivation
- self organization
- discipline
- people from different teams

The first thing you have to do is to change this situation by using the **collaboration** skill. Gather people around you who are interested
into this topic and also share the same opinions. Most important thing is to break the communication barriers between **Frontend Engineers** and **Product Designers**.
Once you found those people you should find a balance between talking, listening, educating and learning from each other.
You should always understand both sides and needs and this implied that you have to be flexible and open-minded.

#### Difference Between a Team and a Guild

The main difference is that a guild is a group of people who are **sharing the same interests**. Those people are
working **accross** the whole company. Let's take a look at this visual to get a better understanding:

![](./guild-illustration.png)

In our scenario we have UI Guild, which is doing **Collaborative UI Development** for a Pattern Library. The main goal for this
guild is to **share knowledge**. To make life a bit easier I would recommend to define a responsible person to handle all the
internal and external communcation within your guild.

> Only with collaboration, we'll be able to share the same language amongst the company - get everyone on board and try to educate people about your Pattern Libaray or Design System.

## Use Formats

Once you found a group you can play around with format which are working for you. Here are some examples:

- create meetings with your group on a regular basis to discuss upcoming changes
- write documentation about the usage of your UI components and discuss it together with your **Product Designer**
- use communication tools like slack for internal communication, but also for external communication. Imagine you want
  to annouce a breaking change or a new component in your Pattern Library.
- Eveangalize your guild and the project (e.g. Pattern Library or Design System) in your company
- do presentations in your company to get more attention about this topic
