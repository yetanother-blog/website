# Hello World

This is my first post on my new fake blog! How exciting!
I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future.
Oh, and here's a great quote from this Wikipedia on
[salted duck eggs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg).

> A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck
