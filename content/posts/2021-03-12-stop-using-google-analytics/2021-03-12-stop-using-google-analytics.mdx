title: "Stop using Google Analytics"

  Do you really need Google Analytics for your website? We used it, and we switched to another 
  tool because we want to respect the privacy of our visitors, sell fewer data to one of the biggest companies in the world, and improve the usability of our blog.

When we started this blog last year, we made a list of things we have to do for the launch. 
Our list included a rough design concept, a logo, avatars for social media, and 
all the boring legal requirements. We live in Europe, so a privacy and cookie policy, 
legal details (aka. _Impressum_ in Germany) plus, the most annoying feature of all time, 
the cookie law banner felt pretty natural for us. It did feel like a common feature set we 
have to follow. Part of this feature set was also Google Analytics. We wanted to have 
some basic metrics about our website and our decision felt straightforward.

## But why? 

Because everyone does it. Google Analytics is just given. It’s more or less part of every website on the internet. 
We didn’t question it. Also, and most importantly, it’s for “free”. Our blog is a side project, so keeping the costs down 
was very critical for us. 

But over the last months, something changed. Today, we have more discussions about the big tech companies, 
about the way they use our data and analyse our behaviour. We have seen scandals like 
[Cambridge Analytica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica), eye-opening documentaries 
like [The Social Dilemma](https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/), and, personally, the episode 
of [The Changelog](https://changelog.com/podcast/396) with the creators of [Plausible](https://plausible.io), 
a privacy-friendly website tracking tool. 

After the podcast, I understood, that we are responsible for our website and visitors. This one minute it took us to include 
the JavaScript snippet, had a huge impact on our visitors. Without really giving them a choice, we sold their data to one 
of the biggest companies in the world. And why did we do it? Because we want to see simple metrics like page views or referrals. 
Is that responsible action?

## The era of alternatives

The great thing is that, with all the discussions about our data, we also see more and more great alternatives popping up. 
Hosting providers like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/products/analytics/) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com/analytics) offer 
analytics tool, but we also see independent tools like Plausible. We don’t rely on Google Analytics anymore, 
but it also has consequences. The tools are not for free. I believe that’s okay and we just forgot that things aren’t for free. 
The “free” services out there, namely all Google products, are for free because it’s okay for us to give away all our data. 
And not just our data, but also the data of our visitors, users, and customers. We decided that we want to spend money and 
use a service carefully, rather than just including everything on our page because we can.

## Cool side effects

Besides selling less data, the greatest advantage is also the ability to get rid of the cookie law banner. Isn’t it annoying 
to click on these banners over and over and over again every time we open a new page? I deeply believe the intention is good, 
it’s good to inform us and being more transparent, but it certainly didn’t make the internet more user-friendly. With the switch 
to Plausible, we don’t set cookies anymore, so we also don’t need a cookie law banner. You can just go to our website and enjoy 
our content. Plausible’s JS snippet is smaller, so we could even improve the performance of our website.  That’s how the internet 
should work.

In addition to that, also our experience got way better. Honest question: Do you really like the Google Analytics experience? 
Do you enjoy diving into your stats? Probably not. We included Google Analytics, but we never checked it because the console has 
thousands of ugly views, navigations, options, and whatsoever. But we just want to have basic metrics like page views. 
With Plausible, we got a tool that is easy to use and easy to scan. For the first time, I enjoyed using an analytics tool. 

By the way, we also played around with Netlify’s analytics offering, and all the benefits we described here for Plausible also apply to them. 
We also loved the experience, but Plausible is a bit cheaper for us, so we just made a pragmatic decision. 

## Take away

This blog post could be interpreted as a simple Google rant, but that’s not my point. I want to encourage you to re-think the usage 
of Google Analytics. Maybe you have good reasons to use it, or you enjoy the experience. But maybe you don’t. Maybe you have the 
same mixed feelings we had in the last months. I want to encourage you to try out other tools. For a better, privacy-friendly, 
faster and fairer web. Why not?
